Subject: Request to Reschedule - [Original Meeting Title/Topic]

Dear [Attendee Name/Group],

I am writing to request a reschedule of our meeting currently set for [Original Date and Time].

Due to unforeseen academic commitments and deadlines that have recently arisen, I find that I will be unable to attend at the previously scheduled time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I am available to meet on [Propose new date/time 1] or [Propose new date/time 2]. Please let me know if either of these times works for you, or if you have an alternative time that would be more suitable.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
